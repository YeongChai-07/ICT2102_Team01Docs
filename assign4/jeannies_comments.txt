Need to elaborate with some goals and introduction on
how you went about the heuristic evaluation.

Heuristic evaluation list can be made better by summarizing 
what are the most severe items compared to the others 
(for example, prioritization or sorted list of severity)
Or some kind of graph with prioritized heuristics
and also what has been chosen to fix, and what you are ignoring
and not fixing (hopefully not that many not fixing?)

Also recommend to include the final fixed prototypes and some description
and illustration on what you fixed. 

Good reflective summary. 

Some of the stuff in the appendix needs to come up in the report.

Tentative Grade: B
