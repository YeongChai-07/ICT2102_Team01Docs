Sounds like you have already decided the shape and form of the app
before you started the needfinding and requirements phase. The
elicitation and other methods seem to already be influenced by that.
The solution should not be given before fully understanding
the problem via the elicitation methods.

I think it's framed wrongly, as you're trying to understand the 
existing methods and systems before giving your solution.
The statement "observe the users’ behavior when they are operating the
current system (a.k.a. our ‘​ prototype​)" isn't quite correct.

The task analysis seems to be very UI centric based on other applications
rather than the actual task and trying to find the problem.

You need to analyze the results of the elictiation to arrive at the 
user needs. Right now the user needs are not tied to the results
of the elictiation. The questionnaire results are not summarized.

Right now there's no proper summary of results 
to justify why you have these implications.  

Otherwise the appendix and work done is very comprehensive including
the questions and analysis of the survey. It is better to summarize 
the results of the survey in the main document.
Attach the survey form copy in the appendix.

Tentative Grade: B
